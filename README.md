# 📊 Regime-Aware Probabilistic Forecasting of Stock Prices using Bayesian LSTM and Markov Switching Models

This project focuses on forecasting stock prices by combining **Markov Switching Models (MSM)** for detecting market regimes and **Bayesian LSTM** to provide probabilistic forecasts with uncertainty estimation.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional stock price forecasting lacks regime awareness and uncertainty estimation.  
This project aims to:
- Detect different **market regimes** (bull/bear/volatile)
- Forecast future prices while **quantifying uncertainty**
- Leverage **Bayesian LSTM** to give confidence intervals
- Adapt forecasts based on **market regime changes**

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- **Markov Switching Models (MSM)** – regime detection using time series volatility/returns
- **Bayesian LSTM** – LSTM with Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty-aware forecasting
- **Technical Indicators** – RSI, Moving Averages, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.
