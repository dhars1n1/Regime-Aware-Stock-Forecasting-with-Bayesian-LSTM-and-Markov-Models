## üîÆ What is Bayesian LSTM Inference?

### Traditional LSTM vs Bayesian LSTM

| Traditional LSTM | Bayesian LSTM |
|------------------|---------------|
| Single prediction per input | Multiple predictions with uncertainty |
| "The return will be 0.023%" | "The return will be 0.023% ¬± 0.005%" |
| No confidence measure | 95% confidence interval: [0.018%, 0.028%] |
| Overconfident in volatile markets | Appropriately uncertain during crises |

### Why Monte Carlo Dropout?

*The Problem*: Standard neural networks give point estimates without uncertainty quantification.

*The Solution*: Monte Carlo Dropout approximates Bayesian inference by:
1. Keeping dropout layers active during inference (training=True)
2. Running multiple forward passes with different dropout masks
3. Treating each pass as a sample from the posterior distribution
4. Aggregating samples to get mean (prediction) and std (uncertainty)

*Mathematical Foundation*:

p(y|x, D) ‚âà (1/T) Œ£ p(y|x, Œ∏‚Çú)

Where:
- p(y|x, D) = posterior predictive distribution
- T = number of MC samples
- Œ∏‚Çú = network weights with different dropout masks

## üîÑ Step-by-Step Inference Process

### Step 1: Load Model Artifacts

python
def load_artifacts(self):
    # Load .h5 model (weights + architecture)
    self.model = keras.models.load_model("bayesian_lstm_model.h5")
    
    # Load scalers (CRITICAL - prevents data leakage)
    with open("scalers.pkl", 'rb') as f:
        self.scalers = pickle.load(f)
    
    # Load regime encoder
    with open("regime_encoder.pkl", 'rb') as f:
        self.regime_encoder = pickle.load(f)


*Why Each Artifact is Critical*:

| Artifact | Purpose | What Happens Without It |
|----------|---------|-------------------------|
| *Model (.h5)* | Neural network weights | Cannot make predictions |
| *Feature Scaler* | Transform raw data to training scale | Garbage predictions (wrong scale) |
| *Target Scaler* | Transform predictions back to original units | Predictions in wrong units |
| *Regime Encoder* | Map regime labels to integers | Cannot handle regime information |
| *Metadata* | Feature names, order, config | Wrong feature order = wrong predictions |

### Step 2: Data Preparation

python
def prepare_inference_data(self, df):
    # 1. Extract features in EXACT training order
    feature_df = df[self.metadata['feature_columns']]
    
    # 2. Encode regimes using TRAINING encoder (no refit!)
    feature_df['regime_label'] = self.regime_encoder.transform(
        feature_df['regime_label']
    )
    
    # 3. Scale features using TRAINING statistics (no refit!)
    features_scaled = self.scalers['features'].transform(feature_df.values)
    
    # 4. Create sequences matching training format
    X_sequences = create_sequences(features_scaled, self.sequence_length)


*Critical Points*:
- *No refitting*: Use training statistics to prevent data leakage
- *Exact order*: Features must match training order exactly
- *Same preprocessing*: Apply identical transformations as training

### Step 3: Monte Carlo Dropout Inference

python
def monte_carlo_dropout_inference(self, X, n_samples=100):
    mc_predictions = []
    
    for i in range(n_samples):
        # üî• KEY: training=True keeps dropout active!
        y_pred = self.model(X, training=True)
        mc_predictions.append(y_pred.numpy())
    
    # Aggregate statistics
    mean = np.mean(mc_predictions, axis=0)     # Best estimate
    std = np.std(mc_predictions, axis=0)       # Uncertainty
    lower_ci = np.percentile(mc_predictions, 2.5, axis=0)
    upper_ci = np.percentile(mc_predictions, 97.5, axis=0)


*Why This Works*:

1. *Dropout as Bayesian Approximation*: Each forward pass samples different network configurations
2. *Variance = Uncertainty*: Higher variance indicates model uncertainty
3. *Ensemble Effect*: 100 predictions are more robust than 1
4. *Confidence Intervals*: Quantify prediction uncertainty

*Interpretation Guide*:

| Scenario | Mean | Std | Interpretation |
|----------|------|-----|----------------|
| Normal Market | 0.002 | 0.001 | Confident prediction |
| Crisis Period | -0.015 | 0.008 | Uncertain (appropriate!) |
| Regime Change | 0.005 | 0.012 | Very uncertain |

## üìä Evaluation Metrics: Why These Choices?

### Point Prediction Metrics

#### 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
python
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)

*Why chosen*: 
- Most interpretable for financial returns
- Robust to outliers
- Same units as predictions (log returns)

*Interpretation*: Average prediction error in percentage points

#### 2. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
python
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred))

*Why chosen*:
- Penalizes large errors more than MAE
- Standard metric for regression
- Sensitive to outliers (good for detecting poor performance)

#### 3. R-Squared (R¬≤)
python
r2 = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)

*Why chosen*:
- Shows fraction of variance explained
- Scale-independent comparison metric
- Industry standard for model comparison

*Financial Context*: R¬≤ of 15-20% is excellent for stock returns!

#### 4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
python
mape = np.mean(np.abs((y_true - y_pred) / (np.abs(y_true) + 1e-8))) * 100

*Why chosen*:
- Scale-independent 
- Easy to communicate to stakeholders
- Handles near-zero returns safely

### Uncertainty Quantification Metrics

#### 1. Coverage Rate
python
coverage_95 = np.mean((y_true >= lower_ci) & (y_true <= upper_ci))

*Why critical*:
- Tests if uncertainty is calibrated
- 95% CI should contain ~95% of true values
- Most important UQ metric

*Interpretation*:
- Coverage = 0.95: Perfect calibration
- Coverage < 0.95: Overconfident (intervals too narrow)
- Coverage > 0.95: Underconfident (intervals too wide)

#### 2. Interval Width
python
interval_width = np.mean(upper_ci - lower_ci)

*Why important*:
- Measures sharpness of predictions
- Narrower intervals are preferred (if well-calibrated)
- Balance with coverage rate

#### 3. Calibration Error
python
calibration_error = |coverage_actual - coverage_expected|

*Why measured*:
- Quantifies miscalibration
- Should be close to 0
- Critical for risk management

### Financial Metrics

#### 1. Hit Rate (Directional Accuracy)
python
hit_rate = np.mean(np.sign(y_true) == np.sign(y_pred))

*Why important*:
- Measures ability to predict direction (up/down)
- More important than magnitude for some strategies
- Random baseline = 50%

#### 2. Information Coefficient (IC)
python
ic = spearmanr(y_true, y_pred)[0]

*Why used*:
- Rank correlation (robust to outliers)
- Standard in quantitative finance
- Measures monotonic relationship
